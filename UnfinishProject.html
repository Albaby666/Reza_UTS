        <h2>About Celebes</h2>
        <p>
            Celebes island also known as Sulawesi, located in Indonesia, is one of the most beautiful islands in the archipelago with stunning
            natural beauty. Its unique geographical shape, resembling the letter K, provides incredible variety in its
            landscape, from white sandy beaches to towering green mountains. Bunaken National Park in the north of the
            island is known as one of the best diving locations in the world, with coral reefs rich in colorful marine
            life. This underwater beauty makes Sulawesi a prime destination for divers and nature lovers. <br><br>
            In the central part of the island, the Toraja highlands are renowned for their rich traditions and culture.
            The Toraja people have a unique custom of elaborate and meaningful funeral ceremonies, where they celebrate
            the lives of the deceased with rituals that reflect their rich culture. The distinctive architecture of the
            Tongkonan traditional house, with its curved roof, is a symbol of Torajan identity and cultural heritage.
            Tourists can explore beautiful traditional villages and experience the hospitality of the local people who
            are steeped in tradition.<br><br>
            Sulawesi is also renowned for its extraordinary biodiversity. Dense tropical forests
            are home to endemic flora and fauna species, such as the anoa and the babirusa, which are found nowhere else
            in the world. Many protected areas on the island, such as the Lore Lindu National Park,
            serve as research and conservation sites to preserve the sustainability of valuable ecosystems. With
            mountain trekking and cave exploration, visitors can witness the pristine natural beauty of
            Sulawesi.<br><br>
            For culinary lovers, Sulawesi offers a variety of mouth-watering dishes, with distinctive and diverse
            flavors. Dishes such as Coto Makassar and Pallubasa are favorites for many visitors, reflecting the fusion
            of local cultures and spices. With all the natural beauty, cultural richness, and culinary flavors on offer,
            Sulawesi is truly a fascinating destination to explore, providing an unforgettable experience for every
            visitor.<br><br>
